Create the above screen in React-Native 

Tab Navigation needs to integrated 
Home tab must be selected 
Icons can be fetched from icons8.com 
Sort, filter, wishlist should be touchable
No need for back icon

Solution:
I have wrap the whole app in tab navigator which is written in ./src/navigator/BottomTab.js. The Home Screen is created separately in src/screens/Home.js and passed inside tab navigator.
