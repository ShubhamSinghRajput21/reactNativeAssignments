# react navigation assignment
### 1. Create Stack, Tab and Drawer Navigator (optional)
### 2. Pass Props and Set it as header title

### Solution
I have created a route.js file in which i have implemented the stack navigator and it is located in src/navigator/route.js
my stack is connected with the tab navigator and code of tab navigator is in bottomtabs.js which is inside screens folder in src.
I have learned to implement the Icons inside project and the navigation part.

while going from home to signup page i have changed the header of signup by passing params
